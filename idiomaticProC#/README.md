## Code Like A Pro

We will not cover things like “How to write an if statement”, “what
is a method signature”, or “what is an object”. 

We are not very concerned about syntax but
instead focus on concepts and ideas. **There is a difference between knowing the syntax of a
language and being able to write clean, idiomatic code.**
